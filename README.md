This repository contains codes and datasets for the time series segmenttion of Sparkasse datasets
# User Segmentation based on the user transactions.
This repository contains jupyter notebooks and datasets that we used in our university project
this repository contains 600 user data and their spendings and in multivariate dataset in addition to user transaction the dataset contains handlers that the user made purchase of

## Description
- Using ROCKET and MINIROCKET algorithms 
- Containing Muti and univariate datsets (multilabel)
- Code to turn the dataset provided by Sparkasse to multivariate dataset
